# Photographer Game Prototype

A game prototype about taking photographs and interacting with objects in the world, similar to games such as: Beyond Good & Evil, Fatal Frame, TOEM.

Made with Godot Engine.

Utilizes convex mesh for collision shape for object detection. Ideally the shape used for object detection should be edited real-time whenever camera properties such as its field of view changes. Also it should calculate how much of the object is covered on the screen. In this prototype, a non-changing shape is used.
